One thing the list above doesn't include, however, is non-fixed expenses like cigarettes. A pack was bought every 2-3 days (we'll say every 2.5 days), which ends up being around 720 DKK/month <strong>(~40% of the remaining money!)</strong>. And that's not including social events where I'd buy even more. The amount I have left is much lower than before:<p><strong>Total Available:</strong> 1.134 DKK/month (13.608 DKK/year)</p><br><p>A lot of the expenses would also go to fast food. Let's say pizza five times a month (sometimes even more often <em>*sigh*</em>). With delivery (as it pretty much always is), that's 635 DKK.<p><strong>Total Available:</strong> 499 DKK/month (5.988 DKK/year)</p><br><p>So now you may be wondering, how is that enough to buy groceries? <em>It isn't</em>. I had some freelance work on the side, earning me quite a good sum of money, but let me put it this way... I don't have anything saved up... like, at all. My spending habits are terrible, but that freelance work (which I barely do anymore) was <em>almost</em> enough to keep me going 90% of the time. But for those 10%, usually at the end of the month, I'd borrow a bit from my parents.</p><br><p>This is a real <em><strong>problem</strong></em>. Unable to save up for when I have to move out of student housing, and driven by my craving for simplicity, I decided to do something about it.</p><br><p>Here is what my expenses look like now:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:right>Amount (DKK)<th style=text-align:left>Description<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:right>+5.800<td style=text-align:left>income<tr><td style=text-align:right>-3.035<td style=text-align:left>rent<tr><td style=text-align:right>-250<td style=text-align:left>insurance (health + apartment)<tr><td style=text-align:right>-170<td style=text-align:left>internet<tr><td style=text-align:right>-42<td style=text-align:left>webserver<tr><td style=text-align:right>-19<td style=text-align:left>mobile data plan<tr><td style=text-align:right>-7<td style=text-align:left>domain (porkbun)<tr><td style=text-align:right>-6<td style=text-align:left>mail (migadu + student discount)</table><p><strong>Total Expenses:</strong> 3.529 DKK/month (42.348 DKK/year) <strong>(10% decrease)</strong><br> <strong>Total Available:</strong> 2.271 DKK/month (27.252 DKK/year) <strong>(22% increase)</strong></p><br><p>I removed expenses like mobile insurance, closed my business account that I don't use anymore, and turned off renewal for domain names except for the one currently in use. Since I don't go to the gym anymore, it seems unhelpful to keep the subscription active.<p>I also moved my mail account from Posteo to Migadu and the website domain from Namecheap to Porkbun, both of which are cheaper than the previous.</p><br><p>Right now, I'm in the middle of removing my web server, as I really only need static site hosting, which is offered for free by GitHub. This saves me around 504 DKK every year.<p>But that's not all! The cost of my internet (200 Mbit up/down) increases from 170 DKK/month to 350 DKK/month. It seems they don't have a deal with student housing anymore, and it's hard to find something much cheaper. After hinting that I may leave because of their new price, they offered 230 DKK, which is still more than I was willing to spend...<p>So from the 10th of July, I won't have internet anymore. Not paying for a webserver or internet affects the numbers like so:<p><strong>Total Expenses:</strong> 3.317 DKK/month (39.804 DKK/year) <strong>(16% decrease)</strong><br> <strong>Total Available:</strong> 2.483 DKK/month (29.796 DKK/year) <strong>(34% increase)</strong><p>That is significant!</p><br><p>This is the list after those changes:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:right>Amount (DKK)<th style=text-align:left>Description<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:right>+5.800<td style=text-align:left>income<tr><td style=text-align:right>-3.035<td style=text-align:left>rent<tr><td style=text-align:right>-250<td style=text-align:left>insurance (health + apartment)<tr><td style=text-align:right>-19<td style=text-align:left>mobile data plan<tr><td style=text-align:right>-7<td style=text-align:left>domain (porkbun)<tr><td style=text-align:right>-6<td style=text-align:left>mail (migadu + student discount)</table><p>From 11 to 5 expenses.</p><br><p>So how much do cigarettes take up now? None! As of writing this, I'm about to reach 90 days nicotine-free.<p>The biggest issue currently is my relationship with fast food, and there are a couple of things I can do here:<ul><li>Don't buy it<li>Order it less<li>Buy cheaper fast food<li>Pick up in person (~30% cheaper)<li>Make use of lunch offers (~25% cheaper)</ul><p>While it would be great to completely stop buying it, I think that would make things harder than necessary for now. Instead of ordering weekly or more often, I'll make the following changes:<ul><li>Order it less frequently (at least 10 days between orders)<li>Buy cheaper fast food<li>Pick up in person<li>Make use of lunch offers</ul><p>This should reduce the cost from 635 DKK/month to at least 200 DKK/month, saving me around 5.220 DKK/year.</main><br>
